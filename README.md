## üìñ Introduction

This repository contains various Python scripts for IoT automation projects using the Raspberry Pi 4. The projects demonstrate how to control LEDs, LDRs, sensors, buttons, and relays.

## üçì IoT and Raspberry pi

### What is IoT?

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of physical devices connected to the internet, collecting and sharing data. These devices, equipped with sensors and software, interact with their environment and communicate with each other, enabling intelligent decision-making and automation.

### Why Raspberry Pi for IoT?

The Raspberry Pi is a small, affordable computer ideal for IoT projects. With its GPIO pins, the Raspberry Pi can interface with a variety of sensors and actuators, making it perfect for automation tasks. Its affordability, versatility, and extensive community support make it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

### Benefits of IoT Automation

**Efficiency**: Automate repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing errors.

**Monitoring**: Continuously monitor environments and systems for optimal performance.

**Control**: Remotely control devices and systems from anywhere in the world.

**Data Collection**: Gather data for analysis, enabling informed decision-making and predictive maintenance.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avdhutssh/Iot-Automation-Using-Raspberry-4.git
   cd Iot-Automation-Using-Raspberry-4/raspi-python codes
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Iot-Automation-Using-Raspberry-4
   ```

3. Setup:

    Ensure you have Python and the RPi.GPIO library installed on your Raspberry Pi.

   ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-dev
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio
   ```
